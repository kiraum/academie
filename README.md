 The script can be run with different command-line arguments to execute pecific functions or run all tasks in sequence
 When run with the "run" argument, it performs the following sequence:
 - Fetch data from DE-CIX, AMS-IX, and IX.br
 - Fetch WHOIS and CC2ASN data
 - Process looking glass data
 - Generate reports and summaries for collected data
 The script creates various data files and reports in the "data" and "report" directories
